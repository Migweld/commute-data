# Commute experiment

### Purpose

To ascertain the best time to commute to work, giving the most free time.

### Hypothesis

Morning rush hour is estimated to begin at 0700 and last till approximately 0830-0900. The evening rush hour is estimated to last between 1630 and 1730-1800. It is unlikely that leaving before or after the morning rush hour would be of benefit as leaving before would require waking up at too early a time and leaving afterwards would result in being too late to work. It is estimated that leaving during the morning rush hour would allow me to leave work early enough to avoid the evening rush hour; therefore giving me the most amount of free time.
